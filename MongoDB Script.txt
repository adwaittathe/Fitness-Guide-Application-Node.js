db.Item.insert({itemCode:100, itemName:"Barbell Bench Press", itemCategory:"Chest Workout",itemDescription:"The bench press is often referred to as the king of upper-body exercise. The bench press develops strength in the chest, shoulders, and triceps. Using a barbell allows you to lift more weight than using dumbbells because you do not have to focus on stabilizing the weight as you push up. It's important to keep your feet on the floor for stability and always use a spotter for safety. The bench press should be a staple in your upper-body workouts.",itemRating:3,itemURL : "barbell_press.jpg"})
db.Item.insert({itemCode:101, itemName:"Flat Bench Dumbell Press", itemCategory:"Chest Workout",itemDescription:"The dumbbell bench press is a bench press variation that can be done to boost overall strength, enhance muscle hypertrophy, and isolate areas of weakness in the bench pressing movement for most strength, power, and fitness athletes. The dumbbell press falls within the horizontal pressing domain, which also includes: barbell bench press, push ups, and angular variations (decline, incline, etc). Regardless of the variation, bench pressing can be used by coaches and athletes to enhance overall muscular strength and hypertrophy, but also to improve bench press and overall pressing performance.",itemRating:3,itemURL : "flat_bench_dumbbell_press.jpg"})
db.Item.insert({itemCode :102,itemName : "Peck Deck Machine",itemCategory : "Chest Workout",itemDescription : "The pec deck works the same primary muscle, namely the sternal portion of the pectoralis major. During this exercise, you sit on the seat of the pec deck machine, and place your elbows into arm rests that put your forearms in a vertical position. You then grasp the hand holds at the top of the arm rests, and press your arms toward one another against the resistance of the machine. The assisting or synergist muscles involved are the clavicular portion of the pectoralis major, as well as the pectoralis minor, a small muscle that stretches from the ribs to the front of the shoulder. Also involved is the serratus anterior, a band of muscles along the outer ribs. According to ExRx.net, no stabilizer muscles are involved when using the pec deck.",itemRating : 2,itemURL : "Peck_Deck_Machine.jpg"})
db.Item.insert({itemCode :103,itemName : "Barbell Curl",itemCategory : "Biceps Workout",itemDescription : "Let’s face it, the legs have the squat, the shoulders have the overhead press and the biceps, of course, have the barbell curl. No other exercise is better known for adding size and thickness to your upper arms than holding a loaded barbell and busting out grueling hardcore sets However, even the best exercise can be improved and enhanced and that’s our focus this month; to take an already phenomenal exercise — the standing barbell curl — and show you ways to make it even better If you’re stuck in a rut, despite the fact that you’ve conquered the curl, the writing on the wall is clear: It’s time to make a change for the better. It’s that very reason why we’ve assembled four exercises with all of the essential elements of the curl but with striking differences that’ll stress and target your musculature and your form dramatically.

db.Item.insert({itemCode : 104,itemName : "One Arm Dumbbell Preacher Curl",itemCategory : "Biceps Workout",itemDescription : "Including one arm dumbbell preacher curls in your workout routine is a smart choice if you want to build well-developed biceps. It is an effective movement that is used to gain not just mass but strength in the bicep muscles. One of the biggest factors that makes one arm dumbbell preacher curls effective in increasing the bulk of the biceps is the exceptional isolation of the upper arm through stabilization when it is on top of the preacher curl bench. Added stability is seen through the shoulder joint and front deltoids, and more particular on the forearm muscles along with the wrists and hands to keep a firm grip on the dumbbell. Performing this exercise provides a high concentration to target and develop the upper arm muscles since the flexion and extension from the muscles is optimized.",itemRating : 4,itemURL : "One_Arm_Dumbbell_PreacherCurl.jpg"})
db.Item.insert({itemCode : 105,itemName : "Reverse Cable Curl",itemCategory : "Biceps Workout",itemDescription : "When performing a reverse curl you can either use an EZ curl bar or a straight barbell like an Olympic bar. Don’t go in thinking that you can lift a similar weight to what you can with an underhand grip, the short answer is: you can’t. Start with around half of the weight that you’d usually use for a regular barbell curl for 8 reps. Of course, you can increase it after a set or two but it’s important to get your form right, so a lighter weight should suffice to begin with.Grab the bar with a shoulder width grip with your hands on top of the bar (pronated grip), not underneath as they would be with a regular curl. If you are using an EZ curl bar grip it on the downward-sloping parts of the bar, found just outside the middle straight section. For correct form ensure that your elbows are kept close to your sides with your knees slightly bent, and your hands gripped tightly to the bar, curl it up as you would with aregular curl. The pronated grip that you are using will engage the brachialis muscles in order for you to be able to move the weight. Feel the tension in your forearms as you come toward the top of the curl, hold for a second or two here at then lower slowly. You’ll feel the blood rush to different parts of your arm than you would with a regular curl, stimulating growth in new areas.",itemRating : 3,itemURL : "Reverse_Cable_Curl.jpg"})
